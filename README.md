## My process
Started out creating html page
Created a CSS reset page. 
Style the mobile section first using CSS Responsive Web Design
Created media queries to show case desktop image

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot more about CSS Responsive design. I was able to learn more about media queries and the sizing of certain components.
I know I have more to learn but this was a big step forward and it greatly enhanced my abilities to create front end applications. 

### Continued development
I will continue to learn about responsive design and mobile design. I feel that I can do a lot more when I put mobile design first 
and work from the ground up.
